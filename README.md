ðŸš€ Exciting News: First Task Completed as a Web Development Intern at SkillCraft Technology! ðŸŽ‰

Iâ€™m thrilled to share that Iâ€™ve completed my first task as a web development intern at SkillCraft Technology. ðŸš€

ðŸ’» Project Details: I built an interactive navigation menu with a modern, professional design. The menu includes:

A fixed navigation bar that remains visible while scrolling.
Dynamic hover effects on menu items to enhance user interaction.
The menu changes style when scrolling to give a more engaging experience.
Background images for different sections to make the website visually appealing.
ðŸŽ¨ This project really helped me improve my front-end development skills, specifically in:

Tailwind CSS for responsive and sleek design.
HTML & JavaScript to create smooth interactions and dynamic effects.
Best practices for modern web design.
Hereâ€™s a quick demo of the project: ðŸ”— [Include a link to your demo/project repository/portfolio]

I'm grateful to the team at SkillCraft Technology for this opportunity to apply my learning and grow my skills in real-world projects. ðŸ™Œ
